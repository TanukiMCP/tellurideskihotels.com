## FAQ: Colorado Springs to Telluride

### Is it faster to go through Denver or Pueblo?
The Pueblo route (via US-50) is usually faster and always more predictable. It's 305 miles vs 340 via Denver/I-70, and you avoid all I-70 ski traffic. Only choose the Denver/I-70 route on weekday mornings when traffic is guaranteed light.

### How long does it really take?
Allow 6-7 hours total including stops. The Pueblo route driving time is 5.5-6 hours, plus 30-60 minutes for gas/food/bathroom stops. Weekend I-70 traffic can add 1-3 hours to that route.

### Do I need 4-wheel drive?
Not required in summer. In winter, 4WD or AWD is highly recommended, especially for Monarch Pass. If you have 2WD, you MUST carry chains and check road conditions before leaving.

### Where should I stop for gas?
Fill up in Colorado Springs or Pueblo, then Salida or Gunnison, and finally Montrose (last good prices). Avoid buying gas in Telluride if possible - significantly more expensive.

### Is Monarch Pass dangerous in winter?
Monarch Pass is well-maintained but can be challenging in active snowstorms. It's usually safer than I-70 because there's less traffic. Check COtrip before leaving, and don't drive it during severe weather warnings.

### Can I do it as a day trip?
Technically yes (12+ hours round trip), but not recommended. By the time you arrive in Telluride, it's time to turn around. Better to spend at least one night.

## When to Choose I-70 Instead

Despite I-70's traffic reputation, it's sometimes the better choice:

**Choose I-70 If:**
- Traveling Tuesday-Thursday morning
- Departing before 5:00 AM any day
- You've never driven mountain two-lane highways
- You're uncomfortable with Monarch Pass
- Weather forecast shows US-50 closures

**Choose Pueblo Route If:**
- Weekend travel (Friday-Sunday)
- Want predictable timing
- Prefer less traffic stress
- Enjoy scenic drives
- Want to avoid I-70 completely

## Ready to Hit the Road?

The Colorado Springs to Telluride drive offers an advantage many Denver residents don't have: you can completely avoid I-70 traffic while actually shortening your drive distance. The Pueblo/US-50 route delivers consistent timing, beautiful scenery, and a more relaxed driving experience.

Check [COtrip.org](https://www.cotrip.org) for current conditions, gas up in Colorado Springs or Pueblo, and give yourself 6-7 hours total travel time. Whether you're heading up for a weekend or a week, the drive through Colorado's high country is part of the adventure.
