## Understanding High-Elevation Weather

### Why Telluride's Weather is Unique

**Elevation Effects:**
- Town: 8,750 feet
- Ski summit: 13,150 feet
- Thinner air = more intense sun
- Faster temperature drops
- Quicker weather changes

**Daily Temperature Swings:**
Telluride commonly experiences 30-40°F temperature differences between day and night. A 70°F afternoon can drop to 35°F by midnight.

**UV Radiation:**
At 8,750 feet, UV radiation is 25-30% stronger than at sea level. Sunburn happens fast, even on cloudy days or while skiing.

**Afternoon Thunderstorms (Summer):**
Mountain heating creates daily thunderstorm cycle in summer:
- Morning: Clear, calm
- Noon-1 PM: Clouds building
- 2-4 PM: Storms develop
- 5-7 PM: Storms dissipate

**Rapid Weather Changes:**
Weather systems move fast through the mountains. Blue skies can turn to whiteout in 30 minutes. Always check forecasts and be prepared.

## FAQ: Telluride Weather

### Does it snow in Telluride in summer?
Snow is extremely rare in town during summer, but the summit (13,150 ft) can see light snow any month of the year. Significant summer snow is very unusual.

### How cold does Telluride get in winter?
January is coldest, averaging 29°F highs and 6°F lows. Nighttime temperatures below 0°F are common, and wind chill can make it feel much colder. The record low is around -30°F.

## Final Thoughts: Plan for the Weather

Telluride's high-elevation mountain climate creates dramatic weather with cold winters, mild summers, and intense sun year-round. The key to enjoying your visit is:

✅ **Layer everything** - Temperature swings are huge  
✅ **Protect from sun** - UV is 25-30% stronger at elevation  
✅ **Check forecasts daily** - Weather changes fast  
✅ **Start hikes early** - Avoid afternoon storms (summer)  
✅ **Hydrate constantly** - Altitude + dry air = dehydration  
✅ **Pack for extremes** - Prepare for 40°F temperature swings  

Every season in Telluride offers something special. Whether you're skiing powder in January, hiking wildflowers in July, or photographing aspens in September, understanding the weather helps you pack right, time activities well, and stay safe in the mountains.
