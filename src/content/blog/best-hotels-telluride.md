To plan your timing, check our [ski season guide](/blog/planning-tips/telluride-ski-season-guide) for insights on rates and availability throughout the year.

**Important Note:** Hotel ratings, prices, and amenities are subject to change. Price ranges reflect typical rates but vary significantly by season, room type, and availability. Peak season (Christmas through February) commands premium pricing, while early December and late March offer better value. Always verify current rates and availability directly with hotels or booking platforms before making reservations.

## Quick Picks: Best Hotels by Category

After evaluating dozens of properties, these hotels stand out in their respective categories. [The Madeline Hotel](/places-to-stay) tops our list for luxury and ski-in/ski-out access, combining impeccable service with direct slope access. Hotel Telluride offers the best value proposition with modern amenities and downtown convenience. The New Sheridan Hotel brings authentic Victorian charm right on Main Street. Families consistently praise Peaks Resort & Spa for comprehensive amenities and kids' programs. Budget travelers find Camel's Garden Hotel delivers clean, central accommodations without breaking the bank.

## How We Ranked These Hotels

Our ranking methodology considers six key criteria weighted by importance to typical Telluride visitors. Location accounts for proximity to slopes, downtown walkability, and gondola access—critical factors when deciding where to base your vacation. Amenities include pools, hot tubs, spas, dining options, ski valet services, and parking availability. Value represents the price-to-quality ratio, recognizing that $200/night downtown may offer better value than $800/night slope-side depending on your priorities.

Guest reviews from multiple verified platforms provide real-world insights beyond marketing materials. We analyzed patterns in feedback rather than isolated incidents to identify consistent strengths and weaknesses. Room quality encompasses comfort, cleanliness, modern updates, and views. Service quality reflects staff responsiveness, concierge capabilities, and attention to detail that elevates a good stay into an exceptional one.

## The 15 Best Hotels in Telluride

### 1. The Madeline Hotel & Residences

**Location:** Mountain Village (Ski-In/Ski-Out)  
**Price Range:** $$$$ ($500-1,200/night)  
**Rating:** 4.8/5

The Madeline sets the standard for luxury ski hotels in Telluride. Located steps from Lift 10, this AAA Four Diamond property offers true ski-in/ski-out convenience paired with impeccable service and world-class amenities. You can literally ski from the slopes to your door—a rare convenience even among properties claiming ski-in/ski-out status.

The property features 89 elegant rooms and suites, each appointed with mountain-contemporary furnishings and floor-to-ceiling windows framing spectacular views of the San Juan Mountains. The full-service spa sprawls across 12 treatment rooms, offering everything from hot stone massages to high-altitude facials using alpine botanicals. Multiple dining options include Altitude Restaurant, which serves farm-to-table cuisine with locally sourced ingredients.

*Photo by [SVH Manali](https://www.pexels.com/@svh-manali-1801124329) via Pexels*

The heated outdoor pool and multiple hot tubs provide perfect après-ski relaxation, with mountain views that rival the skiing itself. Ski concierge services go beyond simple storage—valets handle your equipment, have it ready each morning, and can arrange private lessons or guide services. Complimentary s'mores and hot cider in the afternoons create a welcoming atmosphere that feels both luxurious and approachable.

The Mountain View Suites represent the best room category, offering corner units with extra space and stunning vistas across the valley. These suites typically book months in advance for peak season, so plan accordingly. The "Ski, Stay, Spa" package provides 20% off spa services when you book a three-night minimum stay, delivering real value at a property where services can otherwise add up quickly.

### 2. Peaks Resort & Spa

**Location:** Mountain Village (Ski-In/Ski-Out)  
**Price Range:** $$$$ ($400-900/night)  
**Rating:** 4.7/5

The Peaks offers the complete resort experience with 177 rooms, extensive amenities, and true ski-in/ski-out access via a private slope. This property excels for families and groups seeking a full-service mountain escape where you rarely need to leave the premises. The 42,000-square-foot spa ranks as Telluride's largest, featuring everything from traditional massage therapy to altitude-adjustment treatments designed specifically for mountain visitors.

Ski-in/ski-out access arrives via the property's private slope, allowing you to ski directly to the ski valet area without navigating crowds or walking through other properties. The indoor/outdoor heated pool provides year-round swimming, with the outdoor section offering spectacular mountain views while you float in steaming water surrounded by snow. Siam Thai restaurant on-site serves excellent Thai cuisine, eliminating the need for dinner reservations elsewhere.

*Photo by [Thorsten technoman](https://www.pexels.com/@thorsten-technoman-109353) via Pexels*

Kids' activity programs keep children entertained with supervised activities, giving parents freedom to enjoy the spa or slopes without guilt. Private ski lockers provide secure storage, while rooftop fire pits create atmospheric gathering spots for evening s'mores or cocktails. The Deluxe Spa Suites offer the best value, providing direct access to spa facilities and oversized soaking tubs perfect for tired muscles.

The main drawback of this large property is that it can feel less intimate than boutique hotels. Elevators get crowded during check-in/check-out times, and the pool area can be packed on holiday weekends. However, the comprehensive amenities and genuine ski-in/ski-out access justify the trade-offs for most guests.

### 3. Hotel Telluride

**Location:** Downtown Telluride  
**Price Range:** $$$ ($250-500/night)  
**Rating:** 4.7/5

Our top downtown pick combines modern design, excellent service, and prime location just two blocks from Main Street. This 59-room boutique property delivers upscale amenities at mid-range prices, representing the best value proposition for travelers who want quality without ski-in/ski-out premiums. The rooftop hot tubs have become legendary among guests, offering epic mountain views while you soak under the stars.

![Cozy hotel room with mountain view through large window, perfect for relaxation](https://images.pexels.com/photos/30835932/pexels-photo-30835932.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=350)
*Photo by [zeng jinwen](https://www.pexels.com/@zeng-jinwen-679366437) via Pexels*

Complimentary breakfast includes hot items, yogurt, fruit, and baked goods—saving $50-75 daily for couples compared to resort hotel dining. The three-block walk to the gondola takes less than five minutes, providing easy access to Mountain Village and the ski resort. Pet-friendly policies ($75 flat fee per stay) make this a top choice for travelers with dogs, offering dedicated pet relief areas and waste stations.

Afternoon wine and cheese receptions create social atmosphere while providing complimentary appetizers. Ski storage areas include individual lockers and boot dryers, ensuring equipment is warm and ready each morning. The modern boutique design features clean lines, locally sourced artwork, and mountain-contemporary furnishings that feel fresh without being trendy.

The Deluxe King rooms offer the best value, providing ample space and comfortable amenities without the premium pricing of suites. The Telluride Suites work well for families or those wanting extra room, featuring separate living areas and pull-out sofas. Request upper floors for less street noise and better mountain views—the property sits on a quiet side street, but occasional late-night revelers pass by.

### 4. Lumiere Telluride

**Location:** Mountain Village (Ski-In/Ski-Out)  
**Price Range:** $$$$ ($600-1,500/night)  
**Rating:** 4.8/5

Lumiere operates as a luxury condo-hotel offering spacious residences with full kitchens alongside comprehensive hotel services. This model works perfectly for families or groups wanting space, privacy, and ski-in/ski-out convenience without sacrificing amenities like housekeeping and concierge. The massive units range from 1,000 to 3,000 square feet, providing more space than any traditional hotel room.

Full gourmet kitchens feature high-end appliances, gas ranges, and granite countertops, allowing you to prepare meals and save significantly on dining costs during extended stays. In-unit washer/dryers eliminate luggage bulk and laundry service fees—particularly valuable for families with children. Hotel services include daily housekeeping, 24-hour concierge, and ski valet, combining residential comfort with hospitality infrastructure.

Ski-in/ski-out access connects directly to the slopes via a short trail, while private balconies on each unit provide outdoor space for morning coffee or evening cocktails with mountain views. Underground heated parking protects rental cars from snow while keeping walking distances minimal in cold weather. The one-bedroom units work well for couples, two-bedroom layouts suit families of four, while three and four-bedroom residences accommodate groups of 8-12 comfortably.

The nightly rates may initially seem steep, but the per-person cost drops dramatically when you factor in multiple bedrooms. A $1,200/night four-bedroom unit hosting eight people equals $150/person—competitive with mid-range hotels while offering exponentially more space and amenities. The full kitchens further reduce total trip costs by enabling home-cooked breakfasts and lunches.

### 5. Inn at Lost Creek

**Location:** Mountain Village (Ski-In/Ski-Out)  
**Price Range:** $$$ ($350-700/night)  
**Rating:** 4.6/5

This boutique condo-hotel operates just 30 units, providing personalized service and true ski-in/ski-out access at relatively reasonable Mountain Village pricing. The intimate scale allows staff to remember guests' names and preferences, creating a more personal experience than large resort properties. Full kitchens in all units provide flexibility, while the complimentary breakfast saves money and time.

![A luxurious bathtub overlooks the snowcapped mountains, offering a serene mountain escape](https://images.pexels.com/photos/19068961/pexels-photo-19068961.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=350)
*Photo by [Efecan Efe](https://www.pexels.com/@efecan-efe-44398118) via Pexels*

Ski-in/ski-out convenience meets genuine hospitality—ski valets not only store equipment but have it waiting at the ski-out location each morning, waxed and ready. Afternoon cookies and tea provide a homey touch rarely found at corporate hotel chains. The outdoor heated pool and multiple hot tubs offer relaxation after skiing, with less crowding than larger resort properties.

The two-bedroom suites work exceptionally well for families, providing separate sleeping areas for parents and children along with full kitchen facilities. The hotel's compact size means everything stays within a short walk, unlike sprawling mega-resorts where pools and restaurants require lengthy treks through corridors.

### 6. Capella Telluride

**Location:** Mountain Village  
**Price Range:** $$$$ ($800-2,000/night)  
**Rating:** 4.9/5

Capella represents ultra-luxury hospitality with just 23 residences offering the highest level of personalized service and amenities in Telluride. This property caters to guests for whom budget is secondary to experience, delivering the type of white-glove service more commonly found at European palace hotels. The staff-to-guest ratio exceeds most properties several times over, ensuring attentive service without being intrusive.

Butler service handles everything from unpacking luggage to arranging private helicopter tours. Private ski concierge services go beyond equipment storage, coordinating private guides, first tracks experiences, and mountain dining reservations. The massive residences span 2,000 to 4,000 square feet, featuring multiple bedrooms, full gourmet kitchens with wine storage, and living spaces that rival luxury homes.

In-room spa treatments eliminate the need to visit a spa facility, with therapists coming to your residence for massages, facials, and body treatments. The property even maintains a helicopter pad for guests arriving via private aircraft or arranging heli-skiing adventures. This level of luxury comes at eye-watering prices, with peak season rates easily exceeding $2,000 per night.

The property targets celebrities, executives, and guests celebrating major occasions who value absolute privacy and discretion. If budget allows, Capella delivers an unmatched Telluride experience where every detail is anticipated and addressed before you realize you need it.

### 7. New Sheridan Hotel

**Location:** Downtown Telluride (Main Street)  
**Price Range:** $$ ($200-400/night)  
**Rating:** 4.5/5

This historic Victorian hotel dates to 1891 and sits directly on Main Street, offering authentic Telluride character with modern updates and unbeatable location. The building itself tells stories—original woodwork, period details, and Victorian charm create atmosphere that new construction simply cannot replicate. The iconic New Sheridan Bar on the ground floor has served as Telluride's social hub for over 130 years.

![Grand staircase with red carpet in a luxurious hotel lobby, highlighted by a chandelier](https://images.pexels.com/photos/161758/governor-s-mansion-montgomery-alabama-grand-staircase-161758.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=350)
*Photo by [Pixabay](https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay) via Pexels*

The prime Main Street location puts you steps from restaurants, shops, galleries, and nightlife, while the gondola sits just two blocks away. Recently renovated rooms balance historic character with modern comforts—expect period details like crown molding alongside contemporary bedding and updated bathrooms. Afternoon wine receptions provide social opportunities and complimentary appetizers. The rooftop hot tub offers mountain views and a soaking spot after skiing or hiking.

The Premium King rooms represent the best balance of space and value, featuring recent updates and comfortable layouts. Corner Suites provide extra space for those wanting room to spread out. Upper floors offer quieter accommodations, as the ground-floor bar can generate noise until late evening. This trade-off is part of staying in a historic downtown property—you're in the heart of the action, which means some ambient noise.

The New Sheridan delivers authentic Telluride history, prime location, and genuine character at mid-range pricing. It's ideal for travelers who value walkable convenience and atmospheric charm over resort amenities and absolute quiet.

### 8. Mountain Lodge Telluride

**Location:** Downtown Telluride  
**Price Range:** $$ ($200-450/night)  
**Rating:** 4.5/5

This modern condo-hotel combines full kitchens, in-unit washer/dryers, and hotel services at mid-range downtown prices. The property works exceptionally well for families or extended stays where full kitchen facilities provide both convenience and significant cost savings. The combination of residential amenities with hotel services like housekeeping and front desk assistance creates a best-of-both-worlds scenario.

Full kitchens feature modern appliances, cookware, and dining areas, enabling families to prepare breakfasts and lunches while splurging on dinner reservations. In-unit washer/dryers mean you can pack lighter and handle laundry as needed throughout your stay. One to three-bedroom options accommodate different group sizes, with the two-bedroom layouts sleeping six comfortably.

Rooftop hot tubs provide relaxation and mountain views after days of skiing or hiking. The two-block walk to Main Street keeps you close to restaurants, shops, and nightlife without dealing with the noise of being directly on Colorado Avenue. Ski lockers and boot dryers in the building ensure equipment stays secure and dry overnight. Pet-friendly policies welcome dogs, making this a favorite among travelers with four-legged family members.

The two-bedroom units deliver the best value for families, providing separate sleeping areas for adults and children along with full living spaces and kitchen facilities. The Mountain Lodge prioritizes function and value over luxury finishes—expect clean, comfortable, and practical rather than designer touches and high-end materials.

### 9. The Victorian Inn

**Location:** Downtown Telluride  
**Price Range:** $ ($150-280/night)  
**Rating:** 4.3/5

This charming Victorian building offers affordable downtown accommodations with period character and convenient location. The property embraces its historic roots without demanding luxury pricing, making it accessible to budget-conscious travelers who still want central location and Victorian atmosphere. Don't expect resort amenities, but do expect clean, comfortable rooms in a building with genuine historic character.

The central downtown location puts you within easy walking distance of restaurants, shops, and the gondola, while the outdoor hot tub provides relaxation after active days. Complimentary continental breakfast includes basics like coffee, pastries, yogurt, and fruit—nothing fancy, but enough to fuel your morning. Free parking represents a significant perk in downtown where many properties charge $25-40 daily for parking.

Friendly staff create welcoming atmosphere and provide local recommendations for dining, activities, and trail conditions. Standard Queen rooms offer the best value, providing everything you need without extras you don't. Note that some rooms feature shared bathrooms—confirm private bathroom when booking if that matters to you.

The Victorian Inn targets solo travelers, budget-conscious couples, and anyone spending minimal time in their room. If you're skiing all day and exploring town at night, paying for resort amenities you won't use makes little sense. This property delivers location and value, allowing you to allocate budget toward experiences rather than accommodations.

### 10. Fairmont Heritage Place

**Location:** Mountain Village  
**Price Range:** $$$$ ($700-1,800/night)  
**Rating:** 4.7/5

This exclusive private residence club operates luxury condos with Fairmont hotel services, offering ultra-spacious units perfect for multi-family groups or extended luxury stays. The enormous units span 1,700 to 3,400 square feet, featuring two to four bedrooms with space for groups of 8-16 guests. Full gourmet kitchens rival high-end homes, while Fairmont service standards ensure everything from housekeeping to concierge meets five-star expectations.

Ski-in/ski-out access connects to Mountain Village slopes, while private wine lockers allow you to store your favorite bottles at proper temperature throughout your stay. The owner's lounge provides exclusive gathering space for residents, while comprehensive concierge services handle everything from grocery pre-stocking to private chef arrangements.

While nightly rates seem astronomical, the per-person cost for large groups becomes reasonable. A $1,500/night three-bedroom hosting ten people equals $150/person—competitive with mid-range hotels while delivering exponentially more space and luxury. The full kitchens, multiple bedrooms, and large living areas make this ideal for multi-family trips where everyone values both togetherness and privacy.

### 11. Hotel Columbia Telluride

**Location:** Downtown Telluride  
**Price Range:** $$$ ($250-500/night)  
**Rating:** 4.6/5

This modern luxury boutique hotel opened in 2014, bringing contemporary design and excellent service to a prime Main Street location. The property represents Telluride's new generation of accommodations—honoring the town's history while delivering modern amenities and design that appeal to luxury travelers. Clean lines, modern furnishings, and thoughtful details create sophisticated atmosphere without feeling stuffy or overly formal.

The Main Street location puts you in the heart of downtown, with restaurants, galleries, and nightlife immediately accessible. The rooftop bar and hot tubs offer spectacular mountain views and social atmosphere, particularly on sunny afternoon après sessions. Complimentary breakfast saves money while providing quality options. Ski concierge services help arrange equipment, lessons, and lift tickets. Italian linens, rainfall showers, and high-end toiletries deliver luxury hotel touches.

The Deluxe King rooms with mountain views represent the sweet spot, providing excellent vistas without suite premium pricing. Pet-friendly policies ($75/stay) welcome dogs, with designated relief areas and water bowls provided.

### 12. Ice House Lodge

**Location:** Downtown Telluride  
**Price Range:** $$ ($180-380/night)  
**Rating:** 4.4/5

This condo-style property offers full kitchens and multiple bedrooms at reasonable downtown prices, working well for families or groups on moderate budgets who want residential space without resort pricing. One to three-bedroom units accommodate different party sizes, with the larger layouts sleeping six to eight guests. Full kitchens enable home cooking, while rooftop hot tubs provide relaxation and mountain views.

The three-block walk to Main Street keeps you close to town center while avoiding the highest-traffic areas. Underground parking protects vehicles from weather while keeping walking minimal on cold mornings. Pet-friendly policies welcome dogs, though breed restrictions and fees apply.

The Ice House doesn't aim for luxury—think clean, functional, and practical rather than designer finishes. The value proposition lies in the combination of full kitchens, multiple bedrooms, and downtown location at mid-range pricing.

### 13. Camel's Garden Hotel

**Location:** Downtown Telluride  
**Price Range:** $ ($120-240/night)  
**Rating:** 4.2/5

Our top budget pick offers clean, simple rooms in a prime downtown location just one block from Main Street. This property delivers on location and value without pretense—you won't find spa services, gourmet restaurants, or designer finishes, but you will find comfortable beds, hot showers, and easy access to everything Telluride offers.

As the most affordable downtown option, Camel's Garden attracts budget travelers, solo adventurers, and anyone prioritizing experiences over accommodations. The central location means you walk to everything, while complimentary breakfast covers basics. The outdoor hot tub provides relaxation, and ski storage keeps equipment secure.

Standard Queen and King rooms deliver clean, maintained spaces with essential amenities but dated décor and minimal square footage. If you're skiing dawn to dusk and exploring town in the evenings, you'll barely spend time in your room anyway. This practical approach allows you to allocate budget toward lift tickets, dining, and activities rather than luxury bedding and marble bathrooms.

### 14. Oak Street Inn

**Location:** Downtown Telluride  
**Price Range:** $ ($100-220/night)  
**Rating:** 4.1/5

This basic but clean property offers some of the most affordable rates in downtown Telluride, perfect for extreme budget travelers, backpackers, and ski bums who need little more than a bed and hot shower. The lowest rates in the downtown core come with trade-offs—basic amenities, smaller rooms, and some shared bathrooms—but the walkable location and price point serve travelers prioritizing economics over luxury.

Free WiFi and parking (worth $25-40 daily elsewhere) provide real value, while complimentary coffee handles caffeine needs. Clean rooms meet basic standards without extras. Staff is friendly and helpful with local recommendations.

This property targets travelers spending minimal time in accommodations, who view hotels as simply places to sleep between mountain adventures. If that describes your travel style, Oak Street Inn delivers unbeatable downtown value. If you expect modern amenities, daily housekeeping, or aesthetic appeal, look elsewhere.

### 15. Element 52

**Location:** Mountain Village  
**Price Range:** $$$ ($300-600/night)  
**Rating:** 4.5/5

This modern condo-hotel features eco-conscious design, full kitchens, and Mountain Village convenience at mid-range pricing. The property appeals to environmentally aware travelers who appreciate sustainable building materials, energy-efficient design, and eco-friendly operations without sacrificing comfort or location.

Full kitchens and in-unit washer/dryers provide residential convenience, while rooftop hot tubs offer relaxation and mountain views. The walkable distance to the gondola and lifts takes about five minutes—not quite ski-in/ski-out, but close enough to avoid long treks or shuttle buses. Underground parking protects vehicles while keeping everything accessible. Pet-friendly policies welcome dogs with reasonable fees.

The eco-conscious design uses reclaimed materials, energy-efficient systems, and low-VOC paints and finishes, creating healthy indoor environments without compromising aesthetics. The units feel modern and clean with sustainable touches integrated naturally into the design.

Element 52 delivers solid value for travelers wanting Mountain Village proximity without ski-in/ski-out premium pricing. The five-minute walk to lifts remains minimal by most standards, and the full kitchen facilities provide cost savings that offset the walk.

## How to Choose the Right Hotel

Your priorities should drive your hotel selection more than rankings or reviews. If maximizing skiing time tops your list, ski-in/ski-out properties like The Madeline, Peaks Resort, Lumiere, or Inn at Lost Creek eliminate morning commutes and allow you to ski until lifts close without rushing to catch shuttles. These properties command premium pricing, but the convenience justifies costs for serious skiers.

Those seeking downtown atmosphere and walkable nightlife should focus on Hotel Telluride, New Sheridan, or Hotel Columbia. These properties put you steps from restaurants, bars, galleries, and Main Street's Victorian charm. The 10-minute free gondola ride to slopes adds minimal inconvenience while delivering authentic Telluride town experience that Mountain Village cannot replicate.

Families benefit from properties offering kids' programs, multiple bedrooms, and full kitchens. Peaks Resort excels with supervised children's activities and extensive amenities. Lumiere and Mountain Lodge provide multi-bedroom layouts with kitchens that reduce costs and accommodate picky eaters. Inn at Lost Creek's intimate scale means kids can safely explore without parents worrying they'll get lost in sprawling resort corridors.

Budget travelers should prioritize Camel's Garden, Victorian Inn, or Oak Street Inn for downtown locations at basement prices. These properties sacrifice luxury for location and value, betting that you'll spend minimal time in your room anyway. The money saved on accommodations funds lift tickets, dining, and activities that actually create memories.

Luxury seekers willing to pay premium prices for exceptional experiences should consider The Madeline, Capella, Lumiere, or Fairmont Heritage Place. These properties deliver white-glove service, comprehensive amenities, spacious accommodations, and attention to detail that justify high nightly rates. When money is no object, these hotels ensure every aspect of your stay exceeds expectations.

Anyone planning to cook meals should focus on properties with full kitchens: Lumiere, Mountain Lodge, Inn at Lost Creek, or Element 52. Full kitchens allow you to prepare breakfasts and lunches, reducing total trip costs by hundreds of dollars while accommodating dietary restrictions and picky eaters. The in-unit washer/dryers add convenience by eliminating laundry service fees and reducing what you need to pack.

## Booking Tips and Strategies

Timing dramatically impacts both availability and pricing in Telluride. The Christmas through New Year's period requires booking 6-9 months in advance, as properties sell out entirely with 3-4 night minimums and rates 2-3 times higher than normal. Presidents Day and MLK weekends similarly command premiums and require advance planning. Peak season spanning January through March needs 3-4 months advance booking for decent selection and pricing.

Shoulder seasons of early December (before Christmas) and late March (after spring break) offer the best value, with good snow conditions, lighter crowds, and rates 30-50% below peak pricing. These windows provide opportunity for last-minute deals if properties haven't filled. Late March and April deliver rock-bottom pricing for travelers accepting spring conditions and variable weather.

Always compare direct hotel website pricing against third-party booking sites. Hotels increasingly match or beat third-party rates while adding perks like complimentary breakfast, room upgrades, resort credits, or free parking. These extras can deliver $50-150 daily value that third-party bookings don't include. Call hotels directly to ask about packages, promotions, or unadvertised deals—phone-only offers sometimes beat online pricing.

Ski/stay packages bundled with lift tickets often save 15-25% compared to booking separately, particularly at Mountain Village properties with relationships to the resort. Multi-night stays of 5-7 nights may include dining credits, spa discounts, or room upgrades. Always ask about package options when booking.

The Mountain Village versus downtown location decision involves trade-offs beyond just pricing. Mountain Village delivers ski-in/ski-out convenience, modern properties, and resort amenities, but costs more and lacks the authentic Victorian atmosphere and walkable nightlife of downtown. Downtown offers better value, historic character, diverse dining, and more local flavor, but requires the 10-minute gondola ride to slopes each morning (though the gondola is free and runs frequently).

Many visitors split their stay—a few nights in Mountain Village for ski convenience, then moving downtown to experience Main Street's restaurants and nightlife. This approach samples both areas while avoiding full-week commitments to either location.
