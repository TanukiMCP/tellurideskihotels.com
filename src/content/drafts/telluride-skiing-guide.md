## Skiing By Ability Level

### Beginner Skiing at Telluride (23% of Terrain)

**Best Areas:**
- **The Meadows (Lift 10 - Sunshine Express)**
- **Ute Park (Lift 7)**  
- **Galloping Goose (Lift 5 from Prospect)**

**Why Telluride Works for Beginners:**

Despite its reputation for expert terrain, Telluride offers excellent beginner skiing, particularly in Mountain Village. The dedicated learning areas provide wide, gentle slopes with modern high-speed lifts, meaning less time standing in line and more time practicing.

**Top Beginner Runs:**

1. **Double Cabin (from Lift 10):** Perfect first run after ski school, very gentle gradient
2. **Meadows trails:** Multiple green runs in learning area
3. **Galloping Goose:** 4.6-mile gentle cruise (longest run on mountain)
4. **Ute Park trails:** Slightly more challenging greens for progressing beginners

**Beginner Tips:**

- Start at Mountain Village (easier access to beginner terrain)
- Take the Sunshine Express (Lift 10) - high-speed quad to beginner areas
- Avoid Telluride town base initially (steeper, more challenging)
- Galloping Goose is a milestone run - try it once you're confident
- Mid-morning (10 AM - 12 PM) offers best snow conditions for beginners

**What to Avoid:**
- Gondola mid-station access (intermediate/advanced terrain)
- Town base (Lift 8) - runs back to town are blue/black
- Afternoon skiing (snow gets heavy and harder for beginners)

**Progression Path:**
1. Meadows green runs (Day 1-2)
2. Ute Park greens (Day 2-3)
3. Galloping Goose (Day 3-4)
4. Graduate to easier blues like Village Bypass

### Intermediate Skiing at Telluride (36% of Terrain)

**Best Areas:**
- **Prospect Bowl (Lifts 12 & 13)**
- **Village Express (Lift 4)**
- **Revelation Bowl groomed runs**

**Why Telluride is Great for Intermediates:**

The mountain offers an exceptional variety of blue terrain - from cruisy groomers to more challenging steep blues that help you progress to expert level. Telluride's intermediate terrain isn't boring "connector" trails; these are destination runs with incredible views and vertical.

**Must-Do Intermediate Runs:**

1. **See Forever (from Gold Hill Express):** Iconic run with panoramic views, long cruiser
2. **Village Bypass:** Blue run from top of Village Express to Mountain Village
3. **Bushwacker (Prospect Bowl):** Consistent blue, often groomed, great for carving
4. **Magnolia (Prospect Bowl):** Similar to Bushwacker, excellent intermediate terrain
5. **Peek-A-Boo (Prospect):** Slightly more challenging blue, tree-lined
6. **Galloping Goose:** 4.6 miles of mellow intermediate cruising

**Intermediate Tips:**

- Start with Prospect Bowl blues (consistent pitch, well-groomed)
- See Forever is a must-do (best views on mountain)
- Late morning offers best intermediate snow conditions
- Village Express provides quick laps for skill building
- Progress to easier blacks like Butterfly or Kant-Mak-M

**Challenging Blues (Near-Black):**

These help bridge to expert terrain:
- **Palmyra Face (groomed days)**
- **Revelation Bowl (groomed middle section)**
- **Some Prospect Bowl variants**

**What Makes Telluride Blues Unique:**
- Real vertical (not just long traverses)
- Stunning alpine scenery
- Uncrowded compared to other resorts
- Quality grooming

- **Palmyra Peak (hike-to, 13,150 ft)**
- **Revelation Bowl (Lift 15)**
- **Gold Hill Chutes**
- **Black Iron Bowl (hike-to)**
- **The Plunge**

**Why Experts Love Telluride:**

This is where Telluride truly earns its reputation. With 41% advanced/expert terrain including steep moguls, technical tree runs, and hike-to extreme terrain, Telluride offers some of the most challenging in-bounds skiing in North America - with far fewer crowds than resorts like Jackson Hole or Crested Butte.

5. **Black Iron Bowl:** Hike-to from Plunge Express, steep powder stashes
6. **Spiral Stairs:** Technical steep run with rock bands
7. **Kant-Mak-M:** Steep groomer, good warmup for harder terrain

**Hike-To Terrain:**

**Palmyra Peak (13,150 ft):**
- 20-30 minute hike from Prospect Express
- Multiple entry chutes (East, North)
- Requires avalanche awareness
- Best on powder days

**Black Iron Bowl:**
- 10-15 minute hike from Plunge Express  
- Steep, often untracked
- Northwest facing (holds powder)
- Less crowded than Palmyra

**Expert Tips:**
