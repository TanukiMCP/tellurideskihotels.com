# Winter Driving to Telluride: Safety Tips & Road Conditions

Winter driving to Telluride requires preparation, caution, and knowledge of Colorado's unique mountain driving conditions. While the journey offers stunning snow-covered scenery, I-70 through the Rockies and the final approaches to Telluride demand respect—especially during active storms, at night, or when you're unfamiliar with mountain driving.

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need for safe winter travel to Telluride: Colorado traction laws, vehicle preparation, emergency supplies, I-70 conditions, Red Mountain Pass considerations, and local driving strategies that Coloradans use every day.

**Note:** Road conditions change rapidly in the mountains. Always check [COtrip.org](https://www.cotrip.org) and weather forecasts before departing, and be prepared to delay travel during severe storms.

## Understanding Colorado Traction Laws

**The Colorado Traction Law (Code 15) is NOT optional—it's the law.**

### When Code 15 is in Effect

CDOT (Colorado Department of Transportation) activates the Passenger Vehicle Traction Law during winter storms on mountain highways, including I-70. You'll see electronic signs displaying **"Traction Law in Effect"** or **"Code 15."**

### Code 15 Requirements

When Code 15 is active, you MUST have ONE of the following:

**Option 1: 4WD/AWD Vehicle**
- Must have all-wheel or four-wheel drive engaged
- Must have adequate tread depth (3/16" minimum recommended)
- Snow tires or all-season tires with M+S rating

**Option 2: Snow Tires**
- Mountain/Snowflake symbol tires
- On 2WD vehicles
- Front AND rear (not just front)

**Option 3: Chains or Alternative Traction Devices**
- Properly installed chains on drive wheels
- Approved traction devices (AutoSock, etc.)
- On any vehicle type

**What Doesn't Count:**
- ❌ Regular all-season tires on 2WD vehicles (even with M+S rating)
- ❌ AWD with bald or worn tires
- ❌ "I'll drive slow" attitude

**Penalties:**
- $130+ fine if caught without proper traction
- Liability if you cause an accident or delay traffic
- Possible vehicle towing

**Pro Tip from a Local:** Even if you have AWD/4WD, carrying chains is smart. If conditions worsen to Code 16 (chains required), you're covered.

### Code 16: Chains Required

When conditions deteriorate, CDOT upgrades to **Chain Law (Code 16)**, requiring:

- Chains on ALL vehicles (including 4WD/AWD)
- Both drive axles for large trucks
- Exception: Some AWD vehicles with aggressive snow tires may be allowed (trooper discretion)

**When Code 16 is Active:**
- Conditions are severe (whiteout, ice, extreme snow)
- Chain-up stations are designated along I-70
- Don't try to "push through" without chains

## I-70 Winter Driving Realities

I-70 through the Rockies is Colorado's lifeline to the mountains—and its biggest winter headache.

### High-Risk Zones on I-70

**Eisenhower-Johnson Tunnels (Elevation 11,158 ft):**
- Highest point on I-70
- Weather changes dramatically approaching tunnels
- Often 20-30°F colder than Denver
- Wind gusts can reach 50+ mph
- Whiteout conditions common
- Congestion from ski traffic

**Georgetown Hill (MM 228-232):**
- Steep grade before Georgetown
- Frequent accidents in winter
- Chain stations located here
- Often congested during Code 15

**Vail Pass (Elevation 10,662 ft):**
- 7% grade descending westbound
- Black ice common in shadows
- Wind-blown snow reduces visibility
- Runaway truck ramps present (heed warning)

**Glenwood Canyon (MM 116-133):**
- Rock fall danger year-round
- Rockslides during thaw cycles
- Narrow lanes, high walls
- Complete closures possible
- No alternate route when closed

### I-70 Closure Reality

**I-70 DOES Close:**
- During severe storms (blizzards, heavy snow)
- After major accidents (especially multi-vehicle pileups)
- Avalanche mitigation work
- Rock slides (particularly Glenwood Canyon)

**When I-70 Closes:**
- Duration: 2-12+ hours (sometimes overnight)
- Stranded vehicles: Hundreds to thousands
- No alternate route: You wait or turn back
- Services limited: Gas stations, hotels fill up

**Check Before You Go:**
- [COtrip.org](https://www.cotrip.org) - Live cameras, road conditions
- CDOT Alerts: 511 phone line
- Google Maps / Waze: Real-time traffic
- Local news: Denver stations cover I-70 religiously

**Backup Plan:**
- Leave early (6-7 AM) to avoid afternoon storms
- Flexible schedule (delay if conditions bad)
- Montrose route option (avoids I-70 entirely)

## Red Mountain Pass: The Final Challenge

If you're taking US-550 from Ouray or Durango to Telluride, you'll cross **Red Mountain Pass (elevation 11,018 ft)**—one of the most dangerous winter drives in Colorado.

### Why Red Mountain Pass is Different

**No Guard Rails:**
- Sheer drop-offs, no protection
- Narrow lanes
- Historic "Million Dollar Highway"

**Avalanche Danger:**
- Active avalanche paths cross the highway
- CDOT closes for avalanche mitigation
- Sudden closures possible

**Severe Weather:**
- Exposed terrain
- High winds
- Rapid weather changes
- Snowdrifts across road

**Limited Services:**
- Long stretches without gas/services
- Cell service spotty
- Ouray to Telluride: 50+ miles

### Red Mountain Pass Tips

**Best Practices:**
- **Never attempt in a storm**
- Check CDOT conditions before leaving
- Travel during daylight only
- Full gas tank before starting
- Emergency supplies essential
- Consider alternate route if questionable

**When to Avoid:**
- Active storms
- Night driving
- Low visibility
- Post-storm (avalanche mitigation)
- High avalanche danger

**Alternate Option:**
- Montrose to Telluride via CO-62 & CO-145 (adds 30 minutes, much safer)

## Vehicle Preparation for Winter Mountain Driving

### Essential Vehicle Requirements

**Tires (Most Important):**
- Snow tires with Mountain/Snowflake symbol (best option)
- All-season with M+S rating (minimum for AWD/4WD)
- 3/16" tread depth minimum
- All four tires (not just drive wheels)

**Fluids:**
- Windshield washer fluid (winter formula, -20°F rated)
- Antifreeze checked (proper freeze protection)
- Oil appropriate for cold weather

**Battery:**
- Load-tested (cold reduces capacity)
- 3+ years old? Test before trip
- Clean terminals

**Wipers:**
- New blades (winter/beam style best)
- Rear wiper functional

**Lights:**
- All lights working (headlights, brake lights, turn signals)
- Clean lenses (salt film reduces visibility)

**Fuel:**
- Keep tank above half-full
- Fill up before mountain passes
- Don't push it in cold weather

### Emergency Supplies (Keep in Vehicle)

**Essential Safety Gear:**
- Tire chains (even if AWD)
- Ice scraper and snow brush
- Small shovel
- Flashlight with extra batteries
- First aid kit
- Jumper cables or jump starter
- Emergency flares or reflective triangles

**Survival Supplies:**
- Blankets or sleeping bags
- Extra warm clothing, gloves, hats
- Water (non-frozen if possible)
- Non-perishable snacks (granola bars, nuts)
- Phone charger (car adapter + portable battery)
- Matches/lighter

**Tools & Extras:**
- Tow strap
- Kitty litter or sand (traction under tires)
- Duct tape
- Basic toolkit
- Paper towels/rags

**Don't Forget:**
- Cash (some services don't take cards in storms)
- Paper map (cell service unreliable)
- Full gas can (optional but useful)

**Why This Matters:**
If I-70 closes or you get stranded, you could wait hours in your vehicle. Blankets, water, and snacks transform a dangerous situation into a manageable inconvenience.

## Winter Driving Techniques for Mountain Roads

### Speed & Following Distance

**Slow Down:**
- Cut highway speed by 25-50% in snow
- Bridges and overpasses freeze first
- Black ice invisible (looks like wet pavement)
- Downgrades require extra caution

**Following Distance:**
- 8-10 seconds minimum (double summer distance)
- Watch brake lights 3-4 cars ahead
- Don't tailgate snowplows (give 10+ car lengths)
- More space = more reaction time

### Handling Specific Conditions

**Ice & Black Ice:**
- Most dangerous (no traction)
- Common in morning, shaded areas, bridges
- Smooth steering/braking inputs
- Assume any "wet looking" road is ice

**Snow-Covered Roads:**
- Packed snow = some traction
- Fresh powder = very slippery
- Don't brake hard (ABS may not help)
- Gentle throttle inputs

**Downhill Grades:**
- Low gear (don't ride brakes)
- Brake before turns, coast through
- Watch for runaway truck ramps (if you see them, grade is serious)
- Never coast in neutral

**Visibility Issues:**
- Low visibility? Slow way down or pull off
- Turn on headlights (not just DRL)
- Don't use high beams in snow (reflects back)
- Follow road lines/reflectors

### What to Do If You Slide

**Front-Wheel Slide (Understeer):**
- Ease off gas
- Don't brake hard
- Straighten steering wheel
- Wait for traction to return

**Rear-Wheel Slide (Oversteer):**
- Steer into the slide (direction rear is going)
- Ease off gas
- Don't brake
- Counter-steer once traction returns

**All-Wheel Slide:**
- You're going too fast
- Ease off everything (gas, brake)
- Steer where you want to go
- Hope for traction

**The Golden Rule:**
Smooth inputs. Aggressive steering, braking, or throttle = loss of control.

## Chain Installation & Usage

Even experienced drivers can struggle with chains. Practice at home before your trip.

### When to Install Chains

**Code 16 Active:**
- Required by law
- Pull into designated chain-up area
- Don't wait until you're stuck

**Before You Need Them:**
- Conditions deteriorating
- Better to put on early than struggle later
- Easier in chain-up area than on roadside

### Installation Tips

1. **Pull completely off road** (chain-up area or safe pullout)
2. **Hazard lights on**
3. **Chains go on drive wheels** (front for FWD, rear for RWD, front for AWD usually)
4. **Follow manufacturer instructions** (practice before trip!)
5. **Drive 100 yards, re-tighten** (chains settle)

**Speed with Chains:**
- Maximum 30 mph (usually)
- Check chain manufacturer specs
- Remove chains once on bare pavement (damage road and chains)

### Chain Alternatives

**AutoSock / Snow Socks:**
- Textile traction devices
- Easier to install than chains
- Legal alternative to chains in Colorado
- Less durable than metal chains
- Good for occasional use

**Cable Chains:**
- Lighter than traditional chains
- Easier to install
- Less traction than full chains
- Acceptable for Code 15/16

## Timing Your Drive for Safety

### Best Times to Drive

**Early Morning (6-8 AM):**
- Roads recently plowed
- Less traffic
- Before afternoon storms
- Plows active overnight

**Mid-Morning (9-11 AM):**
- Sun warming roads
- Good visibility
- Before ski traffic peaks
- Storm systems usually arrive afternoon

### Times to Avoid

**Friday Afternoons/Evenings:**
- Heaviest ski traffic Denver to mountains
- I-70 parking lot (not exaggerating)
- Accidents more likely
- Longer delays if incidents occur

**Sunday Afternoons (3-7 PM):**
- Return ski traffic (mountains to Denver)
- Eisenhower Tunnel major backups
- Tired drivers
- Consider staying Sunday night

**During Active Storms:**
- Visibility near zero
- Rapid accumulation
- Plows can't keep up
- High accident risk

**Night Driving:**
- Can't see road conditions
- Black ice more common
- Wildlife on roads
- Fatigue factor

**Pro Tip:** If forecast shows afternoon/evening storm, leave at 6-7 AM. You'll arrive before weather hits and avoid traffic.

## What to Do in Emergencies

### If You Get Stuck

1. **Stay with your vehicle** (shelter, easier to spot than person walking)
2. **Call 511** (Colorado road emergency line)
3. **Turn on hazard lights**
4. **Run engine 10 min/hour** (heat, conserve fuel)
5. **Check exhaust pipe clear** (carbon monoxide risk)
6. **Stay awake if possible** (or rotate sleep if passengers)
7. **Make vehicle visible** (bright cloth on antenna, periodic flashlight)

### If I-70 Closes While You're On It

**It Happens:**
- Stranded for hours
- Hundreds of other vehicles
- Limited services

**Survival Strategy:**
- Engine: 10 min/hour (heat)
- Fuel conservation critical
- Share resources with nearby vehicles
- Check CDOT/511 for updates
- Patience (could be many hours)

### Accident or Breakdown

1. **Move off road if possible** (even if damaged)
2. **Hazards on**
3. **Exit vehicle safely** (away from traffic side)
4. **Call 911 if injuries**
5. **Call *CSP (*277)** for Colorado State Patrol
6. **Stay warm, stay visible**

## FAQ: Winter Driving to Telluride

### Do I need chains if I have AWD?
Not always, but you should carry them. Under Code 15, AWD with adequate tires meets the requirement. However, if conditions worsen to Code 16, chains are required for all vehicles. Carrying chains provides flexibility and safety.

### Can I drive a 2WD car to Telluride in winter?
Yes, but it requires snow tires (not just all-seasons) and chains when Code 15/16 is active. Many locals use 2WD vehicles successfully, but AWD/4WD is recommended for winter mountain travel, especially if you're not experienced in winter driving.

### How do I know if I-70 is closed before I leave?
Check [COtrip.org](https://www.cotrip.org) for real-time closure information, or call 511. Google Maps also shows closures. If forecast shows major storm, check multiple times before departing and be prepared to delay travel.

### What's worse: I-70 or Red Mountain Pass?
Red Mountain Pass is far more dangerous due to no guardrails, avalanche danger, and remoteness. However, I-70 sees more accidents due to higher traffic volume. Neither should be attempted during active storms.

### Is winter driving to Telluride worth it?
Absolutely, if you're prepared. Thousands safely drive to Telluride every winter weekend. The key is preparation: proper vehicle, emergency supplies, checking conditions, choosing timing wisely, and being willing to delay if conditions are severe.

### Should I rent an AWD vehicle if I'm flying into Denver?
Yes, highly recommended. The $20-40/day upgrade is worth it for safety and peace of mind. Many rental agencies at Denver Airport offer AWD/4WD SUVs specifically for ski trips.

## Final Thoughts: Respect the Mountain

Winter driving to Telluride isn't something to fear—it's something to respect and prepare for. Thousands of people make the journey safely every weekend during ski season. The difference between a great trip and a dangerous situation often comes down to:

✅ Checking conditions before leaving  
✅ Having the right vehicle and tires  
✅ Carrying emergency supplies  
✅ Leaving early to avoid traffic and afternoon storms  
✅ Being willing to turn around or delay if conditions deteriorate  

Colorado's mountains are beautiful, and Telluride is worth the drive. Just give yourself extra time, stay alert, and trust your instincts. If conditions feel dangerous, they probably are—find a hotel in Silverthorne or Grand Junction and try again tomorrow.
