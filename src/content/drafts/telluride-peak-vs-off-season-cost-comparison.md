**Note:** Cost differences vary by property and dates. Peak season includes holidays (Christmas, New Year's, Presidents Day) which command highest rates. Off-season savings are most significant for accommodations, with lift tickets and activities showing smaller differences.

## Peak Season Overview

Peak season in Telluride spans late December through early March, with highest rates during holiday periods (Christmas week, New Year's week, Presidents Day weekend). Peak season provides optimal snow conditions, full resort operations, best weather reliability, and vibrant atmospheres, but commands premium rates that can be 30-50% higher than off-season periods. Understanding peak season characteristics helps travelers decide whether premium costs justify optimal conditions and experiences.

**Peak Season Dates:** Late December through early March, with highest rates during:
- Christmas week (December 20-31)
- New Year's week (December 31 - January 7)
- Presidents Day weekend (mid-February)
- February school vacation weeks

**Peak Season Advantages:**
- Optimal snow conditions with best reliability

Off-season provides significant cost savings (20-40% lower than peak), smaller crowds, and often good conditions, but may have variable weather, reduced operations, or shorter operating hours. Understanding off-season characteristics helps travelers decide whether savings justify potentially less ideal conditions.

**Off-Season Dates:**
- Early December (before December 20)

**Off-Season Advantages:**
