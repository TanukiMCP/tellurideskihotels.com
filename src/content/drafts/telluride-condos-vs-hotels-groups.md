**Note:** Cost comparisons assume peak season rates. Off-season periods provide 20-40% savings. Per-person costs vary significantly based on group size, with larger groups benefiting more from condos.

## Cost Comparison by Group Size

Per-person accommodation costs vary dramatically based on group size and accommodation type, with condos providing better value for larger groups while hotels may work better for smaller groups. Understanding these differences helps groups choose options that optimize per-person expenses.

**2-Person Groups:**
- Hotels: $300-800 per night ($150-400 per person)
- Condos: $250-600 per night ($125-300 per person)
- **Winner:** Condos provide modest savings (10-20%), though hotels offer convenience that may justify slightly higher costs

**4-Person Groups:**
- Hotels: $500-1,200 per night ($125-300 per person) for suites/connecting rooms
- Condos: $400-900 per night ($100-225 per person)
- **Winner:** Condos provide better value (15-25% savings), especially with kitchen facilities reducing dining costs

**6-Person Groups:**
- Hotels: $900-1,800 per night ($150-300 per person) for multiple rooms
- Condos: $600-1,200 per night ($100-200 per person)
- **Winner:** Condos provide significant savings (25-35%), with kitchen facilities further reducing costs

## Condo Advantages for Groups

Condos provide several advantages for groups that can significantly impact both costs and experiences. Understanding these advantages helps groups decide when condos make sense for their specific needs.

**Space and Privacy:** Condos provide separate bedrooms, multiple bathrooms, and common areas that accommodate groups comfortably. This space allows people to have privacy when needed while maintaining group connection in common areas. Larger groups especially benefit from space advantages that hotels can't match.

**Kitchen Facilities:** Full kitchens allow group cooking that reduces dining costs by 40-50% compared to restaurant meals. Groups can prepare breakfasts and some dinners in accommodations, reserving restaurant dining for special meals. This cost savings accumulates significantly over multi-day trips.

**Cost Efficiency:** Condos typically provide better per-person value for groups of 4+ people, with savings increasing as group size grows. Group bookings often provide additional discounts (10-15%) that further improve value. The combination of lower base rates and dining cost savings makes condos financially attractive for larger groups.

**Group Gathering Spaces:** Common areas provide natural spaces for group meals, games, and socializing that hotels lack. This creates bonding opportunities and reduces need for expensive restaurant dining. Groups staying in condos often find that common areas enhance group experiences.

**Flexibility:** Condos provide flexibility for different schedules, meal preferences, and activity levels within groups. People can prepare individual meals, use spaces independently, and maintain schedules that work for them while still participating in group activities.

## Hotel Advantages for Groups

Hotels provide advantages that may justify higher costs for some groups, especially smaller groups or those prioritizing convenience and services. Understanding these advantages helps groups decide when hotels make sense.

**Convenience and Services:** Hotels provide daily housekeeping, concierge services, equipment storage, and on-site amenities that simplify logistics. This convenience becomes valuable when groups want to focus on activities rather than managing accommodations. Smaller groups especially benefit from hotel services.

**Amenities:** Hotels typically offer pools, hot tubs, fitness centers, restaurants, and bars that condos lack. These amenities create natural gathering spaces and provide entertainment options. Groups prioritizing resort amenities may find hotels worth the additional cost.

**Location:** Many hotels offer ski-in/ski-out locations or proximity to lifts that condos may not match. This convenience eliminates transportation needs and maximizes skiing time. Groups prioritizing ski convenience may prefer hotels despite higher costs.

**Group Coordination:** Hotels often provide group booking services, meeting spaces, and coordination that simplifies group logistics. This becomes valuable for larger groups or events requiring coordination. Some hotels specialize in group accommodations.

**No Maintenance:** Hotels eliminate concerns about cleaning, maintenance, or property management that condos require. Groups simply check in and enjoy, without worrying about accommodation details. This simplicity appeals to groups wanting hassle-free experiences.

## Dining Cost Impact

Kitchen facilities in condos significantly impact total trip costs, as group cooking reduces dining expenses by 40-50% compared to restaurant meals. Understanding this impact helps groups evaluate the true cost difference between condos and hotels.

**Restaurant Dining Costs (4-day trip, 6 people):**
- Breakfast: $30-50 per person = $720-1,200 total
- Lunch: $25-40 per person = $600-960 total
- Dinner: $40-80 per person = $960-1,920 total
- **Total: $2,280-4,080**

**Condo Cooking Costs (4-day trip, 6 people):**
- Groceries: $15-25 per person per day = $360-600 total
- Some restaurant meals: $40-80 per person = $960-1,920 total
- **Total: $1,320-2,520**

**Savings: $960-1,560 (42-38% reduction)**

This dining cost savings often makes condos more cost-effective even when base accommodation rates are similar to hotels. Groups should factor dining savings into accommodation cost comparisons.

## When to Choose Condos

Choose condos when:
- Group size is 4+ people
- Budget optimization is priority
- Group cooking appeals to your group
- Space and privacy are important
- Group gathering spaces are desired
- Flexibility for different schedules is needed

Condos work best for larger groups wanting to optimize costs while maintaining group connection and flexibility.

## When to Choose Hotels

Choose hotels when:
- Group size is 2-4 people
- Convenience and services are priority
- Resort amenities are desired
- Ski-in/ski-out location is important
- Group coordination services are needed
- Hassle-free experience is preferred

Hotels work best for smaller groups or those prioritizing convenience and services over cost optimization.

## Cost Splitting Strategies

Different cost splitting strategies work for condos vs hotels, as accommodation structures differ. Understanding these strategies helps groups divide costs fairly.

**Condos:** Typically split equally per person, as everyone benefits from shared space regardless of bedroom assignments. A $1,200-per-night condo accommodating 6 people costs $200 per person per night, regardless of who uses which bedroom. This equal division works well because condos provide shared benefits.

**Hotels:** May split per room or per person depending on group preferences. Multiple rooms can be divided by room (each room pays its rate) or per person (total divided equally). Per-person splitting works when rooms have similar rates, while per-room splitting works when room types differ significantly.

**Hybrid Approaches:** Some groups use condos for main accommodations with hotels for overflow guests or different preferences. This provides flexibility while maintaining group connection. The key is establishing splitting methods before booking to prevent conflicts.
