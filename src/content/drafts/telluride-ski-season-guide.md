# Telluride Ski Season: When to Visit & What to Expect (2025)

Telluride Ski Resort typically operates from late November through early April, offering approximately 130 days of skiing across 2,000 acres. However, timing within that window dramatically affects your experience—snow conditions, crowd levels, pricing, and available terrain vary significantly month to month and even week to week.

This complete season guide helps you choose the optimal time to visit Telluride based on your priorities: deep powder, uncrowded slopes, budget considerations, or family-friendly conditions.

**Note:** Prices, dates, and conditions mentioned are estimates based on historical patterns. Always verify current information with official sources at [telluride.com](https://www.telluride.com) before booking.

## 2024-2025 Season Key Dates

**Opening Day:** November 27, 2024 (Wednesday before Thanksgiving)  
**Closing Day:** April 6, 2025 (weather-dependent)  
**Total Days:** Approximately 130 days

**Early Season Opening:**
- Limited terrain initially (30-40%)
- Main lifts and groomed runs
- Depends on snowmaking and natural snow

**Full Mountain Opening:**
- Typically mid-December
- 100% terrain with good snow
- All lifts operating

**Spring Closing:**
- Lift-accessed skiing ends early April
- Backcountry season continues into June
- Closing date shifts based on snow year

## Average Snowfall & Conditions

**Annual Snowfall:** 131 inches (approximately 11 feet)

**Monthly Averages:**
- November: 20 inches
- December: 45 inches
- January: 50 inches (peak)
- February: 45 inches

**Reality Check:** These are averages. Actual conditions vary dramatically year to year:
- **Good Snow Year:** 350+ inches
- **Average Year:** 280-320 inches
- **Low Snow Year:** 220-260 inches

**Note on Snowfall:**
Telluride receives moderate snowfall by Colorado standards—less than some northern resorts—but benefits from drier, lighter "champagne powder" due to its southwest location in the San Juan Mountains. Quality often trumps quantity here.

## Month-by-Month Breakdown
