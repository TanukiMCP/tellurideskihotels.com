## Writing Guidelines

### Readability Standards

**Target Metrics:**
- Flesch Reading Ease: 60-70 (8th-9th grade level)
- Average sentence length: 15-20 words
- Paragraph length: 2-4 sentences (3-5 lines on mobile)
- Active voice: 80%+ of sentences
- Vary sentence structure (mix short and long)

**Formatting Rules:**
- Short paragraphs (mobile-friendly)
- **CRITICAL: Use bullet points SPARINGLY** - Only for short lists of 3-5 items max
- **PRIORITIZE NARRATIVE FLOW** - Write in flowing paragraphs, not outline format
- Numbered lists ONLY for sequential steps or rankings
- Bold for emphasis (sparingly - 1-2 times per section)
- Subheadings every 300-400 words
- White space for visual breathing room

**❌ AVOID: Over-Using Bullet Points**

Do NOT write articles that look like outlines or PowerPoint presentations. Use bullets only when listing discrete items that don't need explanation.

**Bad Example (TOO MANY BULLETS):**
```
The hotel offers great amenities:
- Outdoor pool
- Hot tubs with mountain views
- Full-service spa
- Ski valet service
- Complimentary breakfast
- Rooftop fire pits
- Underground parking
```

**Good Example (NARRATIVE FLOW):**
```
The hotel delivers a full resort experience with an outdoor heated pool and multiple hot tubs overlooking the peaks. The 12,000-square-foot spa offers everything from deep tissue massages to alpine stone therapy, while the ski valet handles your equipment each morning. Start your day with the complimentary breakfast buffet, end it around the rooftop fire pits, and never worry about parking with the underground heated garage.
```

**When to Use Bullets:**
- Quick reference lists (hours, prices, specifications)
- "At a glance" summary boxes
- Short lists of 3-5 related items
- Pro tips or key takeaways (5 items max)

**When to Use Narrative Paragraphs (90% of content):**
- Descriptions of places, experiences, hotels
- Explaining concepts or processes
- Telling stories or providing context
- Comparing options
- Providing recommendations
- EVERYTHING ELSE

### Content Depth

- Answer the main question thoroughly
- Anticipate follow-up questions
- Provide context and background
- Include practical details (prices, hours, seasons)
- Address different user scenarios
- Compare options when relevant

**Specific Details:**
- Exact locations (addresses, mile markers)
- Current prices (ranges if exact unavailable)
- Operating hours and seasons

**Balanced Perspective:**
- Acknowledge pros and cons

- Provide alternatives for different needs
- Don't oversell or hide negatives
- Build trust through transparency

5. Find unique angles to differentiate

**Step 3: Document Sources**

## Image Guidelines

### Image Selection

**Hero Image (Required):**
- Landscape orientation (16:9 ratio)
- High quality (1920x1080 minimum)
- Represents main topic
- Visually striking
- Telluride-specific when possible

**Body Images (5-8 per article):**
- Every 300-400 words
- Support surrounding text
- Variety of subjects
- Mix of wide shots and details
- Professional quality

**⚠️ CRITICAL: LANDSCAPE ORIENTATION ONLY**

**Vertical/Portrait images look broken in our blog layout. You must ONLY select landscape/horizontal images.**

**Selection Rules:**
1. When reading the CSV files, look for `width` and `height` columns.
2. **ONLY select images where `width` > `height`.**
3. If dimensions are not available, look for descriptive keywords like "panoramic", "wide", "landscape", "view".
4. **REJECT** images described as "portrait", "vertical", "tall", or "close-up" if they imply vertical orientation.
5. **REJECT** images where the `medium_url` has parameters implying vertical crops (e.g. `h=650` is fine, but check if it looks like a vertical phone shot).

**⚠️ CRITICAL: REAL PRODUCT IMAGES FOR ACTUAL HOTELS**

**NEVER use generic stock photos for hotels we actually sell on our platform.**

When writing reviews or mentions of specific hotels that are bookable through our site:
- **Option 1 (Preferred):** Use the `<HotelShowcase hotelId="..." />` component. This fetches REAL images dynamically from our API.
- **Option 2:** Use `ArticleBookingWidget` with `hotelName` prop (no image, but high conversion).
- **Option 3:** Use generic atmospheric shots (Pexels) for context, but NEVER label them as a specific hotel if they are not.

**Image Sources Priority:**
1. **Real hotel images via `HotelShowcase` component** (see Component Reference)
2. Pexels media library (for atmospheric/contextual content - LANDSCAPE ONLY)
3. Official Telluride resort images
4. Original photography when available

**Never compromise credibility by showing unrelated locations or properties.**

### Media Library System

**⚠️ CRITICAL: IMAGE EMBEDDING IS MANDATORY**

Every article MUST include 5-8 embedded images throughout the body content. Images are NOT optional. Reading the CSV files and selecting appropriate images is a REQUIRED step before writing.

**Location:** All images are stored in CSV files in the `media-library/` directory.

**Available Image Categories:**

Each CSV file contains 30 curated images with full metadata. Use these categories based on article content:

| Category File | Use For | Query |
|---------------|---------|-------|
| `luxury-ski-hotels.csv` | Luxury hotel articles, high-end accommodations | luxury ski hotel |
| `ski-slopes.csv` | Skiing guides, terrain articles, slope conditions | ski resort slopes |
| `hotel-rooms.csv` | Hotel reviews, accommodation details | mountain hotel room |

| `hotel-spas.csv` | Spa amenities, luxury features | hotel spa luxury |

| `colorado-mountains.csv` | General Colorado content, location guides | colorado mountains |
| `hot-tubs.csv` | Hotel amenities, relaxation features | hot tub outdoor |
| `hotel-bedrooms.csv` | Room reviews, accommodation details | hotel bedroom cozy |

**CSV Format:**
```
id,original_url,large_url,medium_url,small_url,width,height,photographer,photographer_url,alt,query
```

**MANDATORY: How to Use the Media Library (STEP-BY-STEP):**

**STEP 1: READ THE CSV FILES** (Do this BEFORE writing the article)
- Use the `read_file` tool to open relevant CSV files from `media-library/`
- Example: For a hotel review article, read `luxury-ski-hotels.csv`, `hotel-rooms.csv`, `hotel-pools.csv`
- Review the available images, their URLs, alt text, and photographers

**STEP 2: SELECT 5-8 IMAGES**
- Choose images that match your article sections
- Select diverse images (don't use all from one CSV)
- Note the `medium_url` and `photographer` info for each

**STEP 3: PLAN IMAGE PLACEMENT**
- Place images every 300-400 words throughout the article
- Match image content to the surrounding text
- First image should appear after 2-3 paragraphs

## Internal & External Linking System

### Internal Linking Strategy

**⚠️ CRITICAL: RESEARCH BEFORE LINKING**

Internal linking is MANDATORY but must be intelligent and accurate. You MUST research the codebase BEFORE writing to understand what content exists and where it lives.

**REQUIRED:** Every article must include 5-10 internal links.

**STEP 1: RESEARCH THE CODEBASE (Do this BEFORE writing)**

Use these tools to understand what exists:

1. **Read the Linking Plan:**
   ```
   read_file tool → INTERNAL_EXTERNAL_LINKING_PLAN.md
   ```
   This shows all article relationships and linking strategies.

2. **Check Existing Articles:**
   ```
   list_dir tool → src/content/blog/
   ```
   See what blog posts actually exist with their exact slugs.

3. **Check Available Pages:**
   ```
   grep tool or codebase_search → Find pages like /lodging, /things-to-do, /ski-conditions
   ```
   Verify main site pages exist before linking.

4. **Understand Article Slugs:**
   - Article URLs follow format: `/blog/[category]/[slug]`
   - Example: `/blog/hotel-reviews/best-hotels-telluride`
   - DON'T guess slugs - verify them from the file listing

5. **Understand Lodging Links:**
   - Hotel listing page: `/lodging`
   - Filter by type: `/lodging?filter=ski-in-ski-out`
   - Filter by location: `/lodging?location=mountain-village`
   - Specific hotel: `/lodging/[hotel-slug]` (research available hotels first)

**STEP 2: PLAN YOUR LINKS**

Before writing, create a mental map:
- Which 2-3 related articles will you link to?
- Which 3-5 lodging pages/filters make sense?
- Which 1-2 main site pages fit naturally?

**Link Types:**

1. **Article-to-Article Links (2-3 per article)**
   - Link to related blog posts
   - Use descriptive anchor text with keywords
   - Reference the `INTERNAL_EXTERNAL_LINKING_PLAN.md` file
   - First mention of a topic = link opportunity
   - **VERIFY THE SLUG EXISTS** before linking

2. **Article-to-Hotel Links (3-5 per article)**
   - Link to specific hotel pages via `/lodging/[hotel-slug]`
   - Link to filtered lodging pages: `/lodging?filter=ski-in-ski-out`
   - Link to location pages: `/lodging?location=mountain-village`
   - Natural contextual placement when mentioning accommodations
   - **RESEARCH AVAILABLE FILTERS** before using them

3. **Article-to-Page Links (1-2 per article)**
   - Link to main pages: `/lodging`, `/things-to-do`, `/ski-conditions`
   - Link to About page when mentioning expertise: `/about`
   - **VERIFY PAGES EXIST** using codebase search

**STEP 3: IMPLEMENT NATURALLY**

Place links where they add value and feel natural:

```markdown
✅ GOOD Examples:

For the ultimate convenience, [ski-in/ski-out hotels](/lodging?filter=ski-in-ski-out) like The Madeline let you access slopes directly from your room.

Learn more about [Telluride's ski terrain and trail breakdown](/blog/ski-guides/telluride-skiing-guide) before your trip.

Compare our [top-rated hotels in Mountain Village](/lodging?location=mountain-village) for slope-side access.

❌ BAD Examples:

Click [here](/blog/skiing) for more info. (Generic anchor text)

Read this article about Telluride skiing. (No link)

[Telluride skiing Telluride skiing Telluride](link) (Keyword stuffing)

Check out our [complete guide](/blog/complete-guide-telluride) (Wrong! Should be /blog/destination-guides/complete-guide-telluride)
```

**Common Link Categories to Research:**

**For Ski Articles, research and link to:**
- `/blog/ski-guides/telluride-ski-resort-guide`
- `/blog/ski-guides/telluride-skiing-guide` 
- `/blog/planning-tips/telluride-ski-season-guide`
- `/lodging?filter=ski-in-ski-out`
- `/ski-conditions`

**For Hotel Articles, research and link to:**
- `/blog/hotel-reviews/best-hotels-telluride`
- `/blog/hotel-reviews/where-to-stay-telluride`
- `/lodging` (main search page)
- `/lodging?location=mountain-village` or `/lodging?location=downtown`
- `/lodging/[specific-hotel-slug]`

**For Planning Articles, research and link to:**
- `/blog/planning-tips/best-time-visit-telluride`
- `/blog/planning-tips/denver-to-telluride-drive-guide`
- `/blog/destination-guides/complete-guide-telluride`

**Strategy:**
- Use this INSTEAD of static images for specific hotels.

### 2. ArticleBookingWidget (Flexible CTA)

**Use Case:** General CTAs, filtered searches, or specific hotels when ID is unknown.

### Widget Placement Checklist (MANDATORY)

Before publishing any accommodation article, verify:

**Required Widgets:**
- [ ] Compact widget within first 300 words
- [ ] 2-3 default/compact widgets throughout body (every 300-500 words)
- [ ] Featured widget before conclusion section
- [ ] Minimum 3 widgets total per article
- [ ] Maximum 5-6 widgets for long articles (3,000+ words)

**Content Type Guidelines:**

| Article Type | Minimum Widgets | Recommended Placement |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Hotel Reviews/Listicles | 4-5 | Intro, after every 2-3 hotels, before conclusion |
| Destination Guides | 3-4 | Intro, mid-article, before conclusion |
| Comparison Articles | 3-4 | Intro, after each comparison section, conclusion |
| Planning Guides | 2-3 | Mid-article transition points, conclusion |
| Ski Guides | 2-3 | When mentioning lodging proximity, conclusion |

**Best Practices:**

**Frequency:**
- 1 widget every 300-500 words of accommodation content
- Use featured variant once per article (at end)
- Use compact for inline CTAs without disrupting flow
- Use default for prominent CTAs after key sections
- Don't place widgets back-to-back (minimum 200 words between)

**Placement Timing:**
- After providing value and building trust (not in first 2 paragraphs)
- Natural breaks in content flow
- After hotel descriptions or comparisons
- When transitioning between topics
- Before conclusion section (featured variant)

**Customization:**
- Let auto-generated titles work for most cases
- Customize title/description to match surrounding content
- Match variant to placement importance (compact inline, default for sections, featured for conclusions)
- Use specific filters (ski-in-ski-out, luxury, budget, family-friendly) when relevant
- Use location filters (downtown, mountain-village) when discussing locations

**Conversion Optimization:**
- Place featured widget where readers are most engaged (typically before conclusion)
- Use compact widgets as gentle reminders without interrupting flow
- Ensure widget filter/location matches article topic and surrounding content
- Don't interrupt valuable content mid-thought - place at natural breaks
- Front-load widgets in listicles (after items 3, 6, 10, etc.)

**Examples of WRONG Placement:**
```markdown
❌ Telluride offers exceptional skiing and lodging options.

<ArticleBookingWidget variant="featured" />

The town sits in a box canyon at 8,750 feet...
```
*Problem: Widget before providing any value or context*

```markdown
❌ ...The Madeline offers exceptional service and amenities.

<ArticleBookingWidget filter="ski-in-ski-out" variant="default" />

<ArticleBookingWidget location="mountain-village" variant="compact" />

The Peaks Resort provides family-friendly features...
```
*Problem: Widgets placed back-to-back*

**Examples of CORRECT Placement:**
```markdown
✅ Telluride offers exceptional skiing and lodging options ranging from ski-in/ski-out luxury to downtown boutique hotels. The town sits in a box canyon at 8,750 feet, surrounded by 13,000-foot peaks...

[300 words of valuable content about the destination]

<ArticleBookingWidget 
  variant="compact"
  title="Find Your Perfect Telluride Hotel"
/>

When choosing where to stay, location dramatically impacts your experience...
```
*Correct: Widget after providing context and value*

## Interactive Planning Tools System

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Planning Tools for Group Planning Articles

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Every group planning, cost-focused, or event-based article MUST include at least ONE interactive planning tool. These tools drive engagement, increase time on site, and convert readers into bookings.

### Available Planning Widgets

All planning tools are React components that work in markdown files. Use them directly in your markdown content with JSX-style tags.

#### 1. GroupCostCalculator

**Use Case:** Family trips, friend groups, bachelor/bachelorette parties, any multi-person planning

**Component Syntax:**
```markdown
<GroupCostCalculator 
  groupType="family"
  defaultNights={4}
  defaultGuests={6}
  checkIn="2025-12-20"
  checkOut="2025-12-24"
/>
```

**Props:**
- `groupType`: "family" | "friends" | "couples" | "corporate" | "solo"
- `defaultNights`: number (default: 4)
- `defaultGuests`: number (default: 2)
- `checkIn`: string (YYYY-MM-DD format, optional)
- `checkOut`: string (YYYY-MM-DD format, optional)

**What It Does:**
- User inputs: # of people, # of nights, travel dates
- Calculates: Total trip cost, cost per person
- Shows: Hotel tier recommendations at different price points
- Outputs: "For 6 people, 4 nights: $450/person (budget), $850/person (mid-range), $1,400/person (luxury)"
- Includes CTA: "See Hotels Under $850/person" → filters LiteAPI results

### Mandatory Placement Rules

**REQUIRED FREQUENCY:** Every group planning or cost-focused article must include at least ONE planning tool.

**Placement Strategy:**

**1. After Introduction (REQUIRED)**
Place a planning tool within the first 500 words of any group planning article:
```markdown
Planning a Telluride family ski trip requires careful budgeting and coordination. Use the calculator below to estimate costs for your group size and trip length.

<GroupCostCalculator 
  groupType="family"
  defaultNights={4}
  defaultGuests={6}
/>

Once you have your budget estimate, we'll walk through the best lodging options...
```

**2. Before Major Decision Points**
Place tools before sections where readers need to make decisions:
```markdown
### Hotel vs Condo: Which is Better for Your Group?

Compare costs and amenities for your specific group size:

<HotelSplitCalculator 
  hotelIds={["hotel-1", "condo-1"]}
  scenario="family-of-6"
  defaultGuests={6}
/>

Here's what to consider when choosing...
```

**3. After Cost Breakdowns**
Place tools after explaining cost structures:
```markdown
Telluride trips typically cost $800-$1,500 per person for a 4-day ski trip, depending on lodging and activities.

<BudgetToItineraryPlanner 
  budgetPerPerson={1000}
  tripLength={4}
  groupSize={4}
/>

Let's break down where your budget goes...
```

**4. In Comparison Sections**
Use comparison tools when comparing options:
```markdown
### Peak Season vs Off-Season: Which Should You Choose?

Compare costs and conditions:

<SeasonComparison 
  peakDates="2024-12-20 to 2025-01-05"
  offPeakDates="2025-01-15 to 2025-02-15"
  groupSize={4}
/>

Here's what changes between seasons...
```

### Tool Selection Guidelines

**For Family Articles:**
- GroupCostCalculator (required)
- HotelSplitCalculator (hotel vs condo decisions)
- BudgetToItineraryPlanner (budget planning)

**For Friend Group Articles:**
- GroupCostCalculator (required)
- HotelSplitCalculator (cost splitting)
- CostPerPersonRanking (value comparison)

**For Event Planning Articles:**
- EventPlanningTimeline (required)
- GroupCostCalculator (budget planning)
- LodgingComparisonMatrix (accommodation decisions)

**For Budget Articles:**

### Integration with ArticleBookingWidget

Planning tools automatically include ArticleBookingWidget CTAs based on calculator results. When a tool recommends hotels within a budget or filters results, it includes a booking widget that links to filtered search results.

**Example:**
```markdown
<GroupCostCalculator 
  groupType="family"
  defaultGuests={6}
/>

The calculator above shows recommended hotels. After calculating your budget, use the booking widget below to see available properties:

<ArticleBookingWidget 
  filter="family-friendly"
  variant="featured"
  title="Book Family-Friendly Hotels in Your Budget"
/>
```
