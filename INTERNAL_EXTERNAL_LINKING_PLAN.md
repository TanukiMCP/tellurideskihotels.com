## Execution Plan

1. ✅ Create this plan document
2. Update each article systematically (one by one)
3. Add internal links in natural, contextual places
4. Add external links to authoritative sources
5. Use proper anchor text (descriptive, keyword-rich)
6. Test links work (at least check format)
7. Commit in batches (3-4 articles per commit)

## Link Placement Guidelines

**Internal Links:**
- First mention of topic = link opportunity
- Use descriptive anchor text ("Telluride weather guide" not "click here")
- Link naturally in context
- Don't over-link (5-8 max per article)

**External Links:**
- Verify statistics = link to source
- Mention official info = link to .com or .gov
- Use rel="noopener noreferrer" for security
- Open in new tab (target="_blank") optional

**Anchor Text Examples:**
- ✅ "Learn more about [Telluride skiing terrain and conditions](/blog/ski-guides/telluride-skiing-guide)"
- ✅ "Check current [road conditions on COtrip](https://www.cotrip.org)"
- ❌ "Click here for more info"
- ❌ "Read this"
